Dear, I thought I drop a line
The weather is cool
The folks are fine
I'm in bed each night at nine

Yesterday we had some rain
But all in all, I can't complain
Was it dusty on the train?

Write to the Brown's just as soon as you're able
They came around to call
I burned a hole in the dining room table
And let me see
I guess that's all

Nothing let for me to say
And so I'll close, but by the way
Everybody's thinking of you

I love you
Ooo
Ooo
