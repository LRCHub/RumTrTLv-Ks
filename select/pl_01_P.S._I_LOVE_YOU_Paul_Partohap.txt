The only place I call home
(You are)
Every hope and dream
I've ever had
(You are)
In other lifetimes,
without any doubt
I'll keep choosing you
Like a cool breeze
on a summer day
(You are)
Like a brightest star up
in the sky
(Girl, you shine)
Keep making me wanting more
Girl, you are what
I am looking for
I love you
(love you oh)
I love you in every universe
You'll always be the first
I love you, you're my only one
I love you
(I do)
Love you still, I always will
I want you to know how I feel
And all the promises
that I'll fulfill
(My only one)
(My only love)
The only place I call home
(You are)
Every hope and dream
I've ever had
(You are)
In other lifetimes,
without any doubt
I'll keep choosing you
Like a cool breeze
on a summer day
(You are)
Like a brightest star up
in the sky
(Girl, you shine)
Keep making me wanting more
Girl, you are what
I am looking for
Oh, I love you
(love you oh)
I love you in every universe
You'll always be the first
I love you, you're my only one
I love you
(I do)
Love you still, I always will
I want you to know how I feel
And all the promises
that I'll fulfill
(My only one)
(My only love)
(My only one)
(My only love)
